## SQL-Practice-Project
Practice of SQL functions on Dodger's center dataset


MY FIRST SQL PROJECT!!!

Learning is an exceptionally significant aspect of human growth and development. I’ve promised myself to never stop learning.
Transitioning into tech wasn’t comfortable, but I know it’s worth it.

I’ve been learning for the past six months and currently, I’m on the learning path of SQL.
I decided to put to write my first SQL project, I made sure I put all functions learned into use in this project. It wasn’t an easy task, I had to figure out the exploratory analysis and answer those questions with my SQL query.

I’m happy I finally did something.
Looking forward to greater workflow from my end, kindly stick to my posts as I’ll keep on working harder to showcase my progress in the data field.
